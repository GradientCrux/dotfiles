description: Generating Scripts to Install Developer Tooling
globs: 
---
Create an installation script that follows these specifications:

1. File Naming and Location:
   - Name the file as "install_{group}_{tool}.bash"
   - The script should be placed in a scripts directory
   - Ensure the file uses #!/usr/bin/env bash for compatibility

2. Script Structure:
   - Start with strict error handling (set -euo pipefail)
   - Define TOOL_NAME and GROUP_NAME variables at the top
   - Calculate CONFIG_DIR relative to script location
   - Include modular functions for different operations
   - End with a main() function call

3. Required Functions:
   - log(): Timestamp-based logging function
   - is_tool_installed(): Check if tool exists in PATH
   - get_current_version(): Tool-specific version checking
   - check_config_dir(): Verify config directory exists
   - install_tool(): Tool-specific installation process
   - upgrade_tool(): Tool-specific upgrade process
   - main(): Primary execution flow

4. Installation Logic:
   - Check for existing config directory
   - Verify if tool is already installed
   - If installed: Check version and upgrade if needed
   - If not installed: Perform fresh installation
   - Handle both success and error states

5. Code Style:
   - Include clear comments explaining complex operations
   - Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
   - Follow shellcheck guidelines
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Quote all variable expansions

6. Error Handling:
   - Fail fast on any error
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Include cleanup for failed operations
   - Check for required dependencies

7. Output Format:
   - Use structured logging with timestamps
   - Clearly indicate installation/upgrade progress
   - Show version information when relevant
   - Indicate successful completion

8. Platform Compatibility:
   - Ensure script works in both bash and zsh
   - Handle platform-specific paths and commands
   - Use portable shell constructs
   - Avoid system-specific assumptions
